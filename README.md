# StreaVR (Cardboard)
Another commercial product done by me. Useful app in which you can buy “events” and watch videos from different categories in both 360 and 2D mode. Videos are from server, can be streamed or downloaded. Slick clean interface. Long-term ongoing project.

# About Me
Every single game is built on Unity engine using C# as primary programming language. I've been using some plugins such as: Vuforia, Photon, ARCore, VRTK, Native Android plugins and so on. Also I have some experience with Unreal Engine and Blueprints.
